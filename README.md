# Noodles_FitnessPal
This mobile application intended to let the user know his BMI, BMI Type, and arrange his healthy diet Aswell as provide him with workouts based on his BMI Type.
About 65% of the people in this world are unsatisfied with how their bodies look. We decided to create an app that would help people achieve the bodies they have always wanted, And to do that they must enter their physical attributes such as height and weight. There are many fitness apps in the market today but what makes our app unique is that we combined all of these apps into one, for example we have apps that only show a diet plan, apps that only show a workout plan or calorie counter. Fitness Pal is going to be an app that Calculates BMI, Suggest workout plan, Suggest diet plan, and has a calorie counter. All these features into one app. We believe if the user follows all the suggested plans the user would reach his/her desired BMI. We want to help solve World Obesity.
